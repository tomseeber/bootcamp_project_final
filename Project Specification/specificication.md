Must get data from database via pandas or pyspark.


## 5.  Optimization or attempts at optimazation.

Target score is R scared score of 80

## 5.  Readme.md that serves as a final report

Should include full EDA. Preprocessing and ETL, raw SQL and python code.
Should include all analysis in markdown.
Should be organized in a logical fashion and have extensive details with screenshots.

## 6.  PDF slides of a 5-10 minute walk through of the project.
This walkthrough must include technical details and the Q/A will include technical quesions. 

## 7.  Sumbission into this github repo.
